subtitle: "Making continuous latents for task-oriented dialogue great again"
---

Latent action reinforcement learning for task-oriented dialogue has seen success at benchmarks such as MultiWOZ.
Categorical latents have been argued to be the best choice.
We show that with conitnuous latents and re-formulation of the ELBO objective and the reinforcmenet learning stage, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance on MultiWOZ.
